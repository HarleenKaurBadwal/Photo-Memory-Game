# Photo-Memory-Game
This Android app implements a simple photo memory matching game. When launched, the game presents a grid of eight cards (initially showing blank images), arranged in four rows and two columns. Underneath these cards are hidden pairs of matching images placed randomly at each new game start. Players tap on cards to reveal the hidden images, aiming to remember their positions to find matching pairs. Once two cards are selected, the app checks if they match: if so, the matched pair remains visible and becomes unclickable; if not, the cards stay visible briefly, then flip back after a short delay, prompting the player to memorize their locations. The game continues until all pairs are matched, enhancing memory skills through interactive gameplay. The code neatly handles UI setup, shuffling images, managing game state, user interaction, and providing visual feedback through simple messages indicating matches or mismatches.
